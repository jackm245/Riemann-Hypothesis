Visualising and Investigating the Riemann Hypothesis
====================================================
Throughout this coursework, I will be examining the Riemann Hypothesis; to be able to visualise this important conjecture and make itâ€™s complex mathematical structures accessible for anyone who is interested in mathematics. This project will be heavily based on how to compute and plot recursive mathematical functions on the complex plane, and testing whether the Riemann hypothesis is a true statement, as well as how the hypothesis affects mathematics today.

Requirements
============
The requirements to run this code are as follows:
 - python 3.10.2
 - argon2-cffi 21.3.0
 - matplotlib 3.5.1
 - scipy 1.7.3
 - PyQt5 5.15.6
 - pandas 1.4.0
 - python-dotenv 0.19.2

Writeup
