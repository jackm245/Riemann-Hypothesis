Was checking to see if answer not already in db, so add it if its not in
but one queried what was already in db, and look to see if answer in it
the list of items in db ws not formatted how i expected it

so fix is to change list of items in db to correct format

to test after change input test input1 and test input2 and riemann.
Tests did appear in db - good
riemann didnt show up again - good
now just need to remove the extra info from the db and should work properly
